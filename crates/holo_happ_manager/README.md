# holo_happ_manager

This is a script that is used by the Holo's hApp-manager profile.

It publishes hApps that is set in the env `HOLO_PUBLISHED_HAPPS`.

We will be using it to publish `Cloud Console` that will use the core-app DNA
and the `Holofuel` hApp

Please read the test for all the environment var that need to be set for this script
